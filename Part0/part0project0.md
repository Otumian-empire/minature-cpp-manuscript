# project 0

In this project, you will create a folder, create the _helloword_ application but this time add your name, compile and execute the binary then delete the binary after the application has worked as expected. This application will create `Hello world <YourName>!!!` on the screen, followed by a new line. The output will be similar to `Hello world, Dennis Ritchie!!!` if _Dennis Ritchie_ is your name.

- create a folder, `helloworldcpp`
- create a file, `helloworld.cpp`, in `helloworldcpp`
- Now, write a hello world program in cpp in `helloworld.cpp` file
- compile the cpp file as, `c++ helloworld.cpp -o app`
- run the cpp binary as, `./app`
- finally, delete `app`, the cpp binary
