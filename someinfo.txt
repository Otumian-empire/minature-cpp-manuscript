It will be required that you download and install a c++Â  compiler from http://www.mingw.org/. This video will be of great help. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guM4XS43m4I
Secondly, Create a free github account at github.com and install git from https://git-scm.com/download/win. Accept the default settings.Download your favourite text editor and let me know when you are done.

We shall start as soon as you are ready.
