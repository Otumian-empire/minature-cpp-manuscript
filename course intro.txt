Hello, I am Otu and I am Programmer and a Tutor.

I am offering a one month 2 weeks online programming tutoring service.

I will be tutoring an introductory course for beginners in programming, using c++.

This is the first part of all the courses which will span over six month. Here, I share all that I have learnt away from academia with you.

I will be your guide and mentor for over a month.

There would be group sessions and one on one. One may opt for python programming instead of c++.

Irrespective of who you are or what you aspire to do, you only become better and nearly reach your goal, when you take the first step, that is, you sign up. What will happen if you sign up? Why not try it. It's free, anyone can take it and it doesn't cost you a dimme - you won't pay until you sign up for the second course. Good luck!!

Well, I will accept any form of assistance, mentally, fiscally and also spreading this information properly.

Reach me by email, via, popecan1000@gmail.com and on telegram, @Otumian_empire or https://t.me/Otumian_empire. You may call/momo me via, +233 542 035 544
