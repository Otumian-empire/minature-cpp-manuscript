Problem - Complete each exercise one at a go and wait for the go ahead.

1. Write a function that calculates and prints the sum of all the natural numbers 
divisible by either 3 or 5, up to a given limit, pass the starting and ending limit
 as argument to the function.
 
The function signature is:
 
int sumNatModBy3and5(int startingLimit, int endingLimit);


2. Write a function that take an integer as argument. The function
should then return 1, -1 or 0 if the number is positive, negative or zero respectively.

The function signature is:

int numberIs(int number);


3. Write a function that takes an integer array and its size as input and then finds
 and returns the sum all the elements.

The function signature is:

int sumOfArray(int sizeOfArray, int intArray);


4. Write a function called dummyParity, taking an array of 20 components of
type int as argument. Return the number of elements that has the same parity as the 
first element.

The function signature is:

int dummyParity(int dummyArray[20]);


5. Write a function that takes an integer array and its size as argument and returns
 index of the to find the greatest number

The function signature is:

int indexOfGreatestNumber(int sizeOfArray, int intArray);

6. Write a function that takes an integer array as argument and returns the greatest number

The function signature is:

int greatestNumber(int sizeOfArray, int intArray);


7. If the last element in an integer array is '\0', write a function takes an arrays a argument 
and returns the number of elements in the array.

The function signature is:

int sizeOfArray(int intArray);


8. Write a function that takes an int year as argument and returns 1 if the year is a leap year,
 else 0

The function signature is:

int isLeapYear(int intYear);


Instructions

Part 1
- Open vscode and create new folder called 'CodeOEXX' (you can also create the folder 
and open it with vscode or prefered editor of your choice)
- where the XX is your initials, just first and last name 
- create a file called 'exerciseX.cpp', where X is the exercise number
- copy and paste the problem into the created 'exerciseX.cpp', and comment it using the
 multi-line commenting style
- write your code
- open the command line, and compile the code as, 'c++ exerciseX.cpp -o app -Wall'
- execute it as, './app'
- if there is issue with the code, ask for assistance else proceed to the next step

Part 2
- create a new file called, '.gitignore'
- open '.gitignore' and add the line, 'app' and '.vscode' (this will make sure that you
 don't push the binary file or any unwanted file onto github
- Now initialize git on you pc (local repository) as , 'git init'
- add 'exerciseX.cpp' to git as, 'git add exerciseX.cpp', where X is the exercise number
- save 'exerciseX.cpp' as, 'git commit -m "<message>" ' (<message>, is a brief description
 of what you did in your code, note that the message has to be in double quote as above)

Part 3
- head to github.com, create an account if you don't have one else log in into your account
- create a new repository named as the folder name, 'CodeOEXX', as you did earlier
(On your github page, at the top right corner of page, closer to the avatar (image), 
there is a plus (+) there, click on it then click on 'New repository' on the drop down
Or on the left side, the side bar of your page where your repositories are displayed, there
 is a green button that says, 'New', click on it)
- enter the repository name as 'CodeOEXX', keep the default and click on 'Create repository' button
- add the remote repository as, 'git remote add origin https://github.com/<User-Name>/<CodeOEXX>.git'
on the commandline in vscode, else navigate to where the project is created. 
- push the code you have locally to the remote repo as ,'git push -u origin master'

Part 4
- pm me for review


Some basic git commands
git add file1
git add file1 file2 ...
git add .

git commit -m "<commit message>"

git push -u origin <branch name>
git pull <branch name>

git brach <branch name>
git checkout <branch name>



Benefits
At the end of the day, you reinforce your knowledge on how to use git.
