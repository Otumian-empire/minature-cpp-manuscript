Document, design and implement a simple console (text) base game of your choice using all that we have learnt till now.
Word of caution, it will be better you break the project down and use separate files for them. It can be any game at all.

Create a new repository for this project. This really shows how much you have learnt.

Thank you and I appreciate your time and effort.
