> Tip: look out for the given inputs ( the available parameters), the desired outputs ( what is expected), and the process ( how to get the output).

**Analyse and design a solution for the following problems.**

1. Given that a quadratic equation is of the form, `Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0` , where `A` , `B` , `C` are real parameters such that `A` , `B` is not zero. `A` and `B` are the co-efficients of `x` , of second and first degrees respectively and `c` a constant. Find and output the roots of the quadratic equation.

1. Find the Area of a circle of radius, `r` , given that `PI` is `3.143` .

1. A shop keeper sold an item of cost, `$340.00` at `$372.99` including a tax of `$2.99` .find the 
    - selling price
    - profit made
    - profit percentage
    - tax percentage
Implement the design from the practicals in `exercise 5 b (Design of a solution)` 

1. write a program that finds the sum then the average of five numbers, by asking the user to enter then as floats. Display all the inputs, the sum and then the average. [Use descriptive outputs]
1. Write a simple program to simulate an interview for Python developers. Display the anwsers in an essay form, with heading, `Your responds` .


* Write a program to take input from the user, print the input, seperated by a short-dash, `-` , and the length of the string. `Eg: input='Doe', output=Doe - 3` 
* Write a program that reads data from the user and converts the data to lower case, upper case, title and capitalize.


Using the new concept in this exercise and the white space character, newline - `\n` , write a program that accepts from the user, inputs, name, age, sex and hobby. Output a descriptive essay of the values taken.


## Practicals

* Find the Truth Value of the following:
    - `True and not False` 
    - `not True and not False` 
    - `True and False and True or False` 
    - `True or False and True or False` 
* Write a simple program that makes use of all the relational and logical operators.


* Write a program that checks if a given integer input is a multiple of 2, 3 or both 2 and 3 and then print what multiple it is with the input.

``` Python
# the code should behave this way

# input = 4
# output = 4 is a multitple of 2

# input = 6
# output = 6 is a multitple of 2 and 3

# input = 9
# output = 9 is a multitple of 3

# input = 18
# output = 18 is a multitple of 2 and 3
```


* write a lift off program using a for loop
* Given a list of alphabets, from `a - z` , use a loop to print out the vowels ( Tips: `list of vowels, loop, condition` )
* Write a program that simulates the rolling of a dice. A fair dice has 6 sides numbered from 1 to 6. Take an integer input from the user as the number of times the dice must be rolled and this value must be greater than 50. Using a `loop` ( any `loop` ) and an `if` , `elif` and `else` statement ( if necessary) and then `print` the number of times a particular number was obtained when the dice was rolled.


* Given a list, whose elements are also list ( talking about nested list), write a function that sorts this list and it list elements if possible


* Implement a function known as `all(iterable)` . This function returns `True` if all of the elements of the `iterable` is `True` or the `iterable` is empty, else `False` .
* Implement a function known as `any(iterable)` . This function returns `True` if any of the elements of the `iterable` is `True` . If the iterable is empty, return False.
* Implement the `abs(x)` function where `x` , is a number.
* Implement a function that returns the minimum and maximum numbers in given list. Don't use the built-in function `min` and `max` .
