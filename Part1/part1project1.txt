Problem - Complete each exercise one at a go and wait for the go ahead

1. Write a program that calculates and prints the sum of all the natural numbers 
divisible by either 3 or 5, up to a given limit entered by the user.

2. Write a program that prompts the user to input a number. The program
should then output the number and a message saying whether the number is
positive, negative, or zero.

3. Write a program that reads a set of integers and then finds and prints the sum
of the even and odd integers. (use an array)

4. Write a program that declares an array epsilon of 20 components of
type int . Initialize the array so that the first 10 components are equal to
the cube of the index variable, and the last 10 components are equal to
three times the index variable. Output the array so that 10 elements per line
are printed.


Instructions

Part 1
- Open vscode and create new folder called 'CodeOEXX' (you can also create the folder 
and open it with vscode or prefered editor of your choice)
- where the XX is your initials, just first and last name 
- create a file called 'exerciseX.cpp', where X is the exercise number
- copy and paste the problem into the created 'exerciseX.cpp', and comment it using the
 multi-line commenting style
- write your code
- open the command line, and compile the code as, 'c++ exerciseX.cpp -o app -Wall'
- execute it as, './app'
- if there is issue with the code, ask for assistance else proceed to the next step

Part 2
- create a new file called, '.gitignore'
- open '.gitignore' and add the line, 'app' and '.vscode' (this will make sure that you
 don't push the binary file or any unwanted file onto github
- Now initialize git on you pc (local repository) as , 'git init'
- add 'exerciseX.cpp' to git as, 'git add exerciseX.cpp', where X is the exercise number
- save 'exerciseX.cpp' as, 'git commit -m "<message>" ' (<message>, is a brief description
 of what you did in your code, note that the message has to be in double quote as above)

Part 3
- head to github.com, create an account if you don't have one else log in into your account
- create a new repository named as the folder name, 'CodeOEXX', as you did earlier
(On your github page, at the top right corner of page, closer to the avatar (image), 
there is a plus (+) there, click on it then click on 'New repository' on the drop down
Or on the left side, the side bar of your page where your repositories are displayed, there
 is a green button that says, 'New', click on it)
- enter the repository name as 'CodeOEXX', keep the default and click on 'Create repository' button
- add the remote repository as, 'git remote add origin https://github.com/<User-Name>/<CodeOEXX>.git'
on the commandline in vscode, else navigate to where the project is created. 
- push the code you have locally to the remote repo as ,'git push -u origin master'

Part 4
- pm me for review
