Problem - This problems test your understanding of functions

1. Write a function that calculates and prints the sum of all the natural numbers 
divisible by either 3 or 5, up to a given limit, pass the starting and ending limit
 as argument to the function.
 
The function signature is:
 
int sumNatModBy3Or5(int startingLimit, int endingLimit);


2. Write a function that take an integer as argument. The function
should then return 1, -1 or 0 if the number is positive, negative or zero respectively.

The function signature is:

int numberIs(int number);


3. Write a function that takes an integer array and its size as input and then finds
 and returns the sum all the elements.

The function signature is:

int sumOfArray(int sizeOfArray, int intArray[]);


4. Write a function called dummyParity, taking an array of 20 elements of
type int as argument. Return the number of elements that has the same parity as the 
first element.

The function signature is:

int dummyParity(int dummyArray[20]);


5. Write a function that takes an integer array and its size as argument and returns
 index of the to find the greatest number

The function signature is:

int indexOfGreatestNumber(int sizeOfArray, int intArray[]);


6. Write a function that takes an integer array as argument and returns the greatest number

The function signature is:

int greatestNumber(int sizeOfArray, int intArray[]);


7. Write a function that takes an int year as argument and returns 1 if the year is a leap year,
 else 0

The function signature is:

int isLeapYear(int intYear);
